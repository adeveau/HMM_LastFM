Code to train a hidden Markov model on my listening history on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm)

demo.py roughly replicates the workflow used to make the blog post about this project [here](https://adeveau.github.io///2017/10/20/hmm_lastfm/). You'll have to supply your own data

post_model.pkl contains a serialized version of the model used in that post.
